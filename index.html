            <strong>The mission of the Baltimore Fitness Academy (BMoreFit) is to improve children’s health and academic performance by addressing obesity and physical inactivity in school-aged children.</strong>  Founded in 2009 as a 501(c)(3) not for profit organization, BMoreFit targets low income, underserved and minority students in Baltimore City public elementary schools. BMoreFit is establishing daily fitness routines in schools where physical education has gone by the wayside.  By reintroducing fitness into their daily lives, these children are learning the value of healthy living and how it affects all aspects of their lives, as well as helping them to improve their academic performance in school.
          </p>
          <p>
          BMoreFit’s signature initiative is an active, classroom-based fitness and wellness program designed to educate and inspire children and teachers to commit to healthy lifestyle choices.  Certified fitness professionals, known to the children as “fitness coaches,” lead children in a variety of exercises and movement sequences during dedicated class time and they train teachers to engage students in “fitness breaks” (brief, organized physical fitness activities) during the school day when children have been sitting for long periods of time or just need to refocus their energies.
          </p>
          <p>
            BMoreFit is beginning its third year targeting elementary school children in Baltimore city public schools.  In the 2014-15 school year, BMoreFit will serve approximately 2,000 elementary school students in five Baltimore city public schools including Holabird Academy, Hampden Elementary, Arlington Elementary, Windsor Hills Elementary and John Eager Howard Elementary. Through the coordination of our coach-led fitness breaks, teacher training, and collateral materials, BMoreFit is addressing the lack of physical activity in Baltimore City, one child at a time.

          “The science is clear.  Physical activity does more than create good health.  It contributes to leadership, productivity, and innovation.  It lowers depression and crime, increases education and income levels, and generates return to business.  It unleashes human potential, and this is what drives economies forward.” (Designed to Move, 2013).
