        <p>Our chief objective for the 2013/14 school year is to get the BMoreFit Kit in the hands of Baltimore City school teachers.  We recognize that youth within the Baltimore City Public School System (BCPSS), like many children throughout the United States, are at risk for childhood obesity and consequent diseases that not only threaten their physical well-being but also the opportunity to become healthy and productive adults.  </p>

        <p>Almost parallel to an increase in childhood obesity is a dramatic rise in the number of students with learning differences and behavior issues.  Despite evidence that demonstrates the critical role regular physical activity plays in weight management, brain function and behavior, it is denied to the people who need it most.  Physical education classes and opportunities to move during the school day have been virtually eliminated due to budget cuts and other concerns.</p>

        <p>Our answer to how to make regular physical activity a priority in the lives of youth, particularly those who are underserved and at-risk, is the teachers and the classroom.  A teacher is often the most consistent adult in a disadvantaged child’s life and the classroom is a requirement.  Teachers are the best positioned to promote and provide physical activity.  The BmoreFit Kit prepares them to give students constructive, safe and effective fitness breaks during the day.  Teachers, once coached by us on how to use to the cards, will motivate students to jump out of their seats before they jump out of their skin.  The BmoreFit Kit in the hands of teachers is a simple, cost-effective and efficient way to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Impact childhood obesity</li>
          <li>Improve the health and well being of students</li>
          <li>Enhance students’ focus and attention in the classroom</li>
          <li>Strengthen students academic performance</li>
        </ul>
