          <p>As a Baltimore City kindergarten teacher at Holabird Academy and the current Miss Baltimore 2013, the health of this great city and its children is a personal priority. I&#x27;ve loved using the <em>BMoreFit</em> program in my classroom every single day as a &ldquo;brain break&rdquo; for my students. In fact, we even watch the Fizz Kidz YouTube videos of Ms. Vicki visiting other classrooms so that we can still dance with her when she isn&#x27;t with us in person! My students love the music so much, that I&#x27;ll hear them singing it while they&#x27;re completing independent work or see them dancing with their friends after-school. Thank you to the <em>BMoreFit</em> program for all that you do for the children of Baltimore, and for helping Holabird take a (&ldquo;dance&ldquo;) step in the right direction!</p>

          <p>The kids LOVED when Miss.Vicki would come in! They looked forward to it all day. Whenever the kids would be tired and zoning out, taking a fitness break was the best thing for them. They loved learning the new dances and hearing the new songs. After we gave each student a copy of the CD, they all talked about how they listened and danced to it at home! We all really enjoyed <em>BMoreFit</em> this summer!</p>

          <p>As a physical education teacher of 18 years, in public schools I thought I&#x27;d give this DVD a try... Glad I did! It is a well-paced dance aerobics video and the students who like dancing truly enjoyed the original, upbeat musical experience. The video also has excellent basic health-related information that is appropriately focused on the elementary aged child. I enthusiastically recommend this to any elementary school or district, and to PTA&#x27;s, and individual parents as a component of a well balanced curriculum or to encourage a healthy kids workout lifestyle.... Great job!</p>

          <p><em>BMoreFit</em> was an entirely positive experience for my students. It helped build community in bringing out shy students and giving the students a common activity they enjoyed. The students loved doing Fizz Kidz at home with their families, and had the lines and moves memorized. The fitness cards allowed me to complete the workouts without technology if need be. The students loved when Vicki visited our classroom and she became our most cherished and consistent visitor. I had no other volunteers that made multiple appearances in the classroom so she really meant a lot to my students. The workouts gave the students an outlet to release energy productively and I had no behavior issues during that time. I would often use the fitness breaks as incentives which also helped with classroom management. Overall I appreciate that I was offered the program free of cost and would definitely want to be included next year.</p>

          <p>I just wanted to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the enormous joy that you provided when you visited my Camp Achieve Scholars this summer.You made exercising so much FUN for them and they looked forward to moving every day.

          <p><em>BMoreFit</em> is absolutely fantastic, and Ms. Vicki is phenomenal! It gets kids moving and helps them focus on their academics. It's great for students, teachers and site managers (I joined in on the fun every time that I was in a classroom). It's a great program for all ages, and we were so thrilled that <em>BMoreFit</em> brought it to us! It was such a big part of Camp Achieve and its success.</p>

          <p>My name is Kristi Porter and I am a 3rd grade teacher at City Neighbors Hamilton.  We have been doing your <em>BMoreFit</em> program every Monday and Tuesday afternoon.  (We start between 1:50 and 2:05.)  This has been the most consistent time to implement fit breaks and provides movement for the times in their week when they would otherwise not get it! They are ALL really enjoying it!  What a great way to get the children to &quot;move and groove&quot; and they are more focused when they return to their academics!  Thank you so much for helping our children incorporate fitness into their school day!</p>
