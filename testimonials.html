          <p>It is with pleasure that I write this letter of support to congratulate and promote the Baltimore Fitness Academy (BMoreFit) and its signature initiative, the Teacher ToolKit.  We have found that there are many benefits of teachers using the toolkit in their classrooms to facilitate fitness breaks throughout the school day.  Regular use of the fitness deck and videos increased our students’ physical activity; improved their general health and conditioning; enhanced their focus and attention; and in some small measure may have even influenced academic performance. You and your team of educators and physical fitness trainers have created a valuable resource; one that should be implemented in every classroom and in every school.</p>

          <p>As a Baltimore City kindergarten teacher at Holabird Academy and the current Miss Baltimore 2013, the health of this great city and its children is a personal priority. I've loved using the BMoreFit program in my classroom every single day as a "brain break" for my students. In fact, we even watch the Fizz Kidz YouTube videos of Ms. Vicki visiting other classrooms so that we can still dance with her when she isn't with us in person! My students love the music so much, that I'll hear them singing it while they're completing independent work or see them dancing with their friends after-school. Thank you to the BMoreFit program for all that you do for the children of Baltimore, and for helping Holabird take a ("dance") step in the right direction!?</p>

          <p>The kids LOVED when Miss.Vicki would come in! They looked forward to it all day. Whenever the kids would be tired and zoning out, taking a fitness break was the best thing for them. They loved learning the new dances and hearing the new songs. After we gave each student a copy of the CD, they all talked about how they listened and danced to it at home! We all really enjoyed BmoreFit  this summer!</p>

          <p>BMoreFit was an entirely positive experience for my students. It helped build community in bringing out shy students and giving the students a common activity they enjoyed. The students loved doing Fizz Kidz at home with their families, and had the lines and moves memorized. The fitness cards allowed me to complete the workouts without technology if need be. The students loved when Vicki visited our classroom and she became our most cherished and consistent visitor. I had no other volunteers that made multiple appearances in the classroom so she really meant a lot to my students. The workouts gave the students an outlet to release energy productively and I had no behavior issues during that time. I would often use the fitness breaks as incentives which also helped with classroom management. Overall I appreciate that I was offered the program free of cost and would definitely want to be included next year.</p>

          <p>I just wanted to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the enormous joy that you provided when you visited my Camp Achieve Scholars this summer. You made exercising so much FUN for them and they looked forward to moving every day. I truly believe that they understand the importance of exercise as well as healthy eating. Moreover, I am excited about continuing the BMoreFit program with my new students in the fall.</p>

          <p>Our scholars have had a wonderful time moving to BMoreFit. Each morning they move with a video, they choose the video exercise! In the afternoon they will select a card and state how many times we should exercise that activity. BMoreFit has been the perfect way to get scholars moving in the morning.</p>

          <p>BMoreFit has enhanced the learning of my students in more ways than one. This program has allowed my students the opportunity to get up and get moving during the school day. My students feel successful because the exercises are age appropriate and easy to follow. The exercises and stretches help them refocus. After a mid-morning "stretch break" the students are able to pay attention and participate. They even sit up taller! Fizz Kidz dances have also given students the opportunity to be leaders. In my classroom I choose 2 students to lead the fitness break.  Every student takes great pride in being a "BMoreFit leader." This teaches the students to respect one another and work as a team. I have greatly enjoyed using this program and highly recommend it to all teachers!</p>

          <p>BMoreFit is absolutely fantastic, and Ms. Vicki is phenomenal!  It gets kids moving and helps them focus on their academics. It's great for students, teachers and site managers (I joined in on the fun every time that I was in a classroom). It's a great program for all ages, and we were so thrilled that BMoreFit brought it to us!  It was such a big part of Camp Achieve and its success.</p>

          <p>We have been doing your BMoreFit program every Monday and Tuesday afternoon.  (We start between 1:50 and 2:05.)  This has been the most consistent time to implement fit breaks and provides movement for the times in their week when they would otherwise not get it!   They are ALL really enjoying it!  What a great way to get the children to "move and groove" and they are more focused when they return to their academics!  Thank you so much for helping our children incorporate fitness into their school day!</p>

          <p>My school has recently begun using the BMoreFit Teacher Toolkit.  So far student and teacher responses have been very positive.  Using the Teacher Toolkit has allowed students to engage in more frequent activity breaks, channel their energy, and focus in the classroom.  As we continue to implement the BMoreFit Toolkit, revisions, and innovations will take place. Students have enjoyed the experience and can later recall and perform movement learned from BMoreFit.  As we continue to learn with BMoreFit we hope to contribute new fitness cards to the Teacher Toolkit decks.</p>

          <p>Hey everyone! I am a third grade teacher in the city and I have been using BMoreFit to get my kids up and moving during transitions.  They get so into it and would continue on if they didn’t run out of breath! It has allowed me a chance to not only bring some excerise into the room but joy as well! The kids love that I am doing the moves with them and we are having a good time together! I have also gotten to bring in lessons in terms of nutrition and reading labels to know what we are actually eating! Try some health related lessons with your kids!</p>
