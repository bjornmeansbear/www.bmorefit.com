          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>Baltimore Fitness Academy DBA/ BMoreFit was founded in 2008 through an Open Society Institute fellowship awarded to Jon Kaplan. Voted Baltimore&rsquo;s &ldquo;best personal trainer&rdquo; by Baltimore Magazine, Jon has spent the last 6 years developing innovative strategies to improve fitness in communities with widespread obesity.</p>
          <p>Across Baltimore, teachers struggle to maintain control of their classrooms. At the same time, our schools lack the money for full-fledged physical education. Budget cuts often eliminate physical education and recess time, but these cuts lead to unintended effects: clinical studies have proven that physical activity keeps students engaged in learning, so the absence of exercise results in disruptive and distracted students, lower test scores, and growing obesity. BMoreFit serves to counter this trend, ensuring that children are getting the exercise they need in school to stay healthy and focused.</p>
          <p>Urgent priority must be given to dramatically increase the world&rsquo;s commitment to get children moving.  Today&rsquo;s children are dropping out of sports and physically active play at a young age.  BMoreFit is working as an ambassador to assist schools in adopting a culture of wellness that stresses a lifestyle of exercise and nutrition.   Through engagement and community partnership, BMoreFit believes that we can fix this problem in Baltimore and beyond.</p>

          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>The mission of the Baltimore Fitness Academy (BMoreFit) is to provide youth with physical fitness skills for lifelong, healthy living. BMoreFit trains and inspires elementary students and teachers to learn the value of healthy living, where the budget for physical education is underfunded. Our mission is to equip our teachers with the skills and materials needed to engage and motivate their students in physical movement, which has the added benefit of helping students to focus during their academic lessons. We work to ensure that our students understand the long-term benefits of living a healthy lifestyle, thus decreasing the possibility of long range health problems. In this way, our program goes beyond the classroom &ndash; our monthly newsletters provide entire families with information central for adopting a healthy lifestyle.</p>
