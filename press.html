            <p>As a Baltimore City kindergarten teacher at Holabird Academy and the current Miss Baltimore 2013, the health of this great city and its children is a personal priority. I&rsquo;ve loved using the <em>BMoreFit</em> program in my classroom every single day as a &ldquo;brain break&rdquo; for my students. In fact, we even watch the Fizz Kidz YouTube videos of Ms. Vicki visiting other classrooms so that we can still dance with her when she isn&rsquo;t with us in person! My students love the music so much, that I&rsquo;ll hear them singing it while they&rsquo;re completing independent work or see them dancing with their friends after-school. Thank you to the <em>BMoreFit</em> program for all that you do for the children of Baltimore, and for helping Holabird take a (&ldquo;dance&ldquo;) step in the right direction!</p>

            <p>In the past year, <em>BMoreFit</em> has been an exciting presence at our school. The students have gained integral knowledge and skills to improving their health. The students speak daily about healthy food, fitness and their bodies. They have knowledge about the way their bodies work and the importance of exercising. As I walk into classrooms throughout the day, I can see and hear music as students are taking fitness breaks! These breaks allow for students to burn off some extra energy and teachers to give students a chance to &quot;reset&quot; themselves and be ready to learn. Students are having fun and engaged in the breaks alongside their peers and teachers. When you ask a student &quot;why do you take <em>BMoreFit</em> breaks?&quot;, they will answer that: it&rsquo;s good for our brains, it gets us ready to learn, it helps us exercise, we need to move, we want to be fit. These answers and so many more explain the importance of <em>BMoreFit</em> at Arlington &mdash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s imperative for our students. The students are the reason each of us is involved with education..and for this reason we are tremendously grateful for <em>BMoreFit</em> to be part of our school system.</p>
            <p>Our children work very hard all day, every day. With reading, writing, phonics, math, science, social studies, health and resource classes and only about 5 hours a day to do it, they are busy, busy, busy! Their brains need a break and their bodies need to move. We do fitness breaks at least two times a day, sometimes more. We dance or do aerobic and stretching exercises. The movement allows children to get that extra energy out and it makes them more able to focus on the next lesson. It gives them a very necessary break that is also structured enough that they do not get too far from academics. They love to be the leader or be the one to choose the activity for the day. They love when Ms. Vicki visits to show us new activities and to teach new information about healthy living. The <em>BMoreFit</em> program gets teachers and children thinking about the physical needs of their body. The program has been accepted with open arms, and we can&rsquo;t wait to have you back next year!</p>

            <p>It&rsquo;s time to move it, move it! The song that gets my Kindergarten class up and moving!  As the country begins to take a hard look at the health problems facing our young people, they are realizing that Obesity and Diabetes are becoming prevalent in young children. That is alarming! Consequently, as we read, write and solve math problems we incorporate fitness breaks. We get moving! In Kindergarten, we have always had Psychomotor built into our schedule. With our partnership with B-More fit, we now have a more focused approach to movement. B&rsquo;More fit provides music that makes you want to move, tips on the ways to move, and vocabulary words exposing students to higher level thinking skills. Our students live in an area where some parents feel it is unsafe for them to play outdoors, so the only time they get to &ldquo;move&rdquo; is at school. Incorporating B-More fits&rsquo; brain breaks gives the student exercise and demonstrates ways they can &ldquo;move&rdquo; in their home. John Eager Howards&rsquo; students love the B&rsquo;More coaches and look forward to the &ldquo;SUPER&rdquo; brain breaks on Tuesday with Coach Jeff; and when Mrs. Vicki comes that is the icing on the cake! Our students need this grant to continue the great work that these coaches are providing to them. We want to be a school that not only excels academically, but also instills life-long healthy habits to all our scholars</p>

            <p>My third grade students here at John Eager Howard, as well as myself, enjoy participating in B More Fit fitness breaks throughout the instructional day. The activities motivate students to get in shape while also helping them focus their attention and develop self-control. The activities are clearly designed to fit into key parts of our daily schedule, class meetings, independent seatwork, walking in the halls, and recess. I appreciate the B More Fit staff for teaching my students strategies on how to not only become, but remain a healthy and fit individual.</p>
